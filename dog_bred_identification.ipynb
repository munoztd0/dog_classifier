    "In the above code, faces is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face. Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face. The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as x and y) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box. The last two entries in the array (extracted here as w and h) specify the width and height of the box.\n",

    "### Write a Human Face Detector\n",
    "We can use this procedure to write a function that returns True if a human face is detected in an image and False otherwise. This function, aptly named face_detector, takes a string-valued file path to an image as input and appears in the code block below."

You will see that our algorithm falls short of this goal, but still gives acceptable performance. We extract the file paths for the first 100 images from each of the datasets and store them in the numpy arrays human_files_short and dog_files_short.\n",

    "Answer: The OpenCV's implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers detects 100.0% of faces in the first 100 images in human_files and 11.0% of faces in the first 100 images in dog_files. When investigating each image where a face has been detected, we can see that for one image there is actually a human in the picture so the classifier is not making a mistake here. For 4 images, the classifier misclassifies the face of a human with a dog. For the rest of them, the classifier seems to detect faces in fur, wrinkle of fabrics..."
